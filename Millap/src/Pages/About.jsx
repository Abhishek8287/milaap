      <h1 className="text-center font-bold text-3xl mb-5">About Us</h1>
      <p className=" font-normal text-base mb-5">
        At Milaap, we are dedicated to creating a world where animals are
        treated with love, kindness, and the respect they deserve. Our
        organization is a haven for animals in need, providing a wide range of
        services that promote their well-being and ensure their protection.

      <h2 className=" text-xl font-semibold">Animal adoption</h2>
      <p className=" font-normal text-base mb-5">
        We believe in the power of adoption to create lifelong bonds between
        animals and humans. Our adoption program matches loving families with
        animals in search of forever homes. We carefully screen both potential
        adopters and the animals to ensure perfect matches, creating a
        harmonious living environment for both. When you choose to adopt from
        us, you're not just gaining a pet; you're adding a new member to your
        family.
      </p>

      <h2 className=" text-xl font-semibold">Founding Animals</h2>
      <p className=" font-normal text-base mb-5">
        Our organization has a strong commitment to the animals that, for
        various reasons, cannot be adopted. These "founding animals" remain
        under our care and become ambassadors for our mission. They serve as a
        source of education, advocacy, and inspiration, reminding us all of the
        importance of our work in protecting and caring for animals.
      </p>

      <h2 className=" text-xl font-semibold">Volunteers</h2>
      <p className=" font-normal text-base mb-5">
        We couldn't do what we do without the dedication and support of our
        volunteers. Our volunteer program is an essential component of our
        organization, and we welcome individuals from all walks of life who
        share our passion for animals. Volunteers help us with animal care,
        adoption events, community outreach, and more. Their unwavering
        dedication is the heart of Animal Haven.
      </p>

      <p className=" font-normal text-base ">
        We are committed to creating a better future for animals, one filled
        with love, respect, and care. Our organization embodies the principles
        of compassion and empathy, and we invite you to join us in making a
        difference in the lives of animals in need. Whether you are an animal
        lover, potential adopter, volunteer, or donor, your support is essential
        in our collective mission to provide sanctuary, hope, and happiness for
        animals. Together, we are building a brighter world for all creatures
        great and small.
